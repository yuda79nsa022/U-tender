"""PASS 18 -- file repository acceptance test: runs the IDENTICAL scenario
against LocalFileStorage and against S3Storage (moto-mocked, real botocore
signing/HTTP path, not just a call-recorder), proving the STORAGE_BACKEND
config switch changes nothing about caller-visible behavior.

Unlike the other test modules here, this one doesn't touch the FastAPI
app or the database at all -- it exercises the Storage classes directly
-- so `conftest.py`'s DB-isolation fixture is irrelevant to it, though
still harmless since it runs regardless.
