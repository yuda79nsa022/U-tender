# uploading a file whose name matches an existing *current* drawing on this
# project supersedes it — the old row's is_current flips false and stays in
# the database and in storage untouched, the new row takes over as current
# at revision+1. Matching by file_name (case-insensitive) is what lets an
# owner "replace" a drawing through the same plain upload control used for
# adding brand new ones, with no separate "replace" UI required.
