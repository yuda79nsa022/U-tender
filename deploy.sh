# One-shot production deploy for U-Tender on a Linux server.
#
# What this does:
#   1. Installs Docker if it isn't already present (via the official
#      get.docker.com script, which supports basically every mainstream
#      distro on its own).
#   2. Detects the server's public IP address.
#   3. Picks two free host ports -- one for the app, one for the API --
#      instead of assuming 80/8000 are free. Most servers hosting other
#      sites already have something bound to 80/443 (a control panel's
#      own nginx, e.g. CloudPanel/Plesk) and sometimes 8000 too, so
#      grabbing those blindly could either fail outright or, worse,
#      collide with another site already running there.
#   4. Creates backend/.env from backend/.env.example the first time this
#      runs, with random secrets generated and APP_URL/API_URL/
#      CORS_ORIGINS pointed at the real public IP and chosen ports
#      instead of localhost.
#   5. Builds and starts the app with docker-compose.prod.yml layered on
#      top of the base compose file -- a real nginx-served frontend build,
#      and MySQL not published to the internet at all.
#
# Safe to run again later: it won't touch an existing backend/.env, and
# docker compose will just rebuild/restart whatever changed. Ports chosen
# on a previous run aren't remembered between runs -- they're only used to
# generate backend/.env the first time; after that, backend/.env itself is
# the source of truth for the ports docker compose publishes.
