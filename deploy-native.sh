#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Native (no Docker) production deploy for U-Tender, for a server that
# already hosts other sites and doesn't have a domain pointed at it yet --
# e.g. a shared CloudPanel/Plesk-style box where 80/443/8000 are already
# taken and there's no CloudPanel "site" for this app.
#
# What this does:
#   1. Installs Python build prerequisites and Node.js if missing.
#   2. Creates a dedicated MySQL database + user for U-Tender on the
#      server's EXISTING MySQL instance (reusing it, not installing a
#      second one) -- needs the MySQL root/admin password once, passed in
#      as MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, and only uses it to create that scoped
#      user; the generated password for that new user is what actually
#      ends up in backend/.env.
#   3. Picks two free ports (same "walk forward from a default until
#      something's free" logic as deploy.sh) for the API and the app.
#   4. Sets up a Python virtualenv for the backend, installs deps, runs
#      the Alembic migrations, and installs it as a systemd service.
#   5. Builds the frontend (VITE_API_URL baked in at build time, same as
#      the Docker path) and serves the static output with `serve`
#      (SPA-fallback aware) as a second systemd service.
#
# Safe to run again: it won't touch an existing backend/.env or an
# already-created database user, and both systemd services get restarted
# with whatever changed.
